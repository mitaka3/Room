# Room
Java class that declares variables to represent the length and width of a room in feet. Assign appropriate values to the variables—for example, length = 15 and width = 25. Compute and display the floor space of the room in square feet (area = length * width). Display explanatory text with the value—for example, The floor space is 375 square feet.
